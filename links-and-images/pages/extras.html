    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>There are three reserved charcters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You should always use HTML entities for these three characters. Entities always being with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). </p>
    <p>In between, you put a special code that your browser will interpret as a symbol. In this case, it interprets lt, gt, and amp as less-than, greater-than, and ampersand symbols, respecitively.</p>

    <h2>Quotes</h2>
    <p>Four different kinds of curly quotes (opening and closing single and double quotes):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;</li>
            <li>&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&lsquo;</li>
            <li>&rsquo;</li>
        </ul>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>

    <h2>UTF-8 and HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>In the olden days of the web, HTML files weren't allowed to have speical characters in them, making entities much more useful. But, since we're now using UTF-8 character set, we should be able to insert any character directly into the HTML document. This makes entities primarily usefuil as reserved characters or form convenience when authoring stright HTML.</p>
