    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings.</p>
        <p>These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings.</p>
        <p>They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>1 Cup Flour:</strong> These dumplings start with all-purpose flour, which creates structure and holds the other ingredients together.</li>
            <li> <strong>2 Teaspoons of Baking Powder:</strong> Baking powder is a leavening agent, which means it releases gas that makes the dough expand. It's responsible for the dumplings' light and fluffy texture.</li>
            <li> <strong>1 Teaspoon White Sugar:</strong> A teaspoon of sugar adds an extremely subtle hint of sweetness. It also helps the dumplings retain their moisture through the cooking process and slows gluten development, which ensures tender dumplings.</li>
            <li> <strong>1/2 Teaspoon Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt seasons the dumplings and enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> <strong>1 Tablespoon Butter or Margarine:</strong> Cold butter or margarine is cut into the flour mixture to bind the dry ingredients together. It also keeps the dumplings light and tender.</li>
            <li> <strong>1/2 Cup Milk:</strong> Whole milk helps create a smooth, moist dough.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Stir in milk and mix until a batter forms that is thick enough to be scooped with a spoon. Allow batter to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
    
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Drop batter by spoonfuls into boiling stew or soup. Cover and simmer without lifting the lid for 15 minutes. Serve.</p>
    
    <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>To make parsley dumplings, add 1 tablespoon parsley flakes to the dry ingredients.</p>

    <h4>How to Tell When Dumplings Are Done</h4>
        <p>To make sure a dumpling is done cooking, pierce it with a fork or toothpick. You'll know it's done when the fork or toothpick comes out clean.</p>

    <h4>How to Store Dumplings</h4>
        <p>You can store leftover cooked dumplings or dumpling soup in an airtight container in the fridge for two to three days. Reheat gently on the stove or in 10-second intervals in the microwave.</p>

    <h4>How to Freeze Dumplings</h4>
    <p>Some people like to freeze dumpling dough for quick and easy cooking. <em>It couldn't be easier:</em> Just drop spoonfuls of dough onto a baking sheet, flash freeze for at least three hours or up to overnight, then transfer the now-frozen dough to a freezer-safe container or zip-top bag. Label with the date and freeze for about three months. When it's time to use them, let the dumplings thaw for about 30 minutes and then drop them directly into the soup or stew
