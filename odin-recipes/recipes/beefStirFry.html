    <h3>Tips</h3>

    <h4>How to Cook Beef Stir-Fry</h4>
        <p>If possible, you should use a wok to make beef stir-fry. Woks are large and have sloping sides that let you cook the entire stir-fry in one pan, so you can easily stir and flip the food without fear of it flying out. They also are designed to cook foods quicker than skillets and with less oil.</p>
        <p>If you can't use a wok (or another carbon steel pan) then any skillet will work. You may just need to cook the meat and veggies in separate batches.</p>
        <p>When cooking, make sure you heat the pan and oil up first before adding your ingredients â€” they should sizzle as soon as they hit the heat. And always use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola or peanut oil, for the best stir-fry results.</p>
        
    <h4>What Cut of Beef Is Best For Beef Stir-Fry?</h4>
        <p>Flank steaks are the most popular choice for making a stir-fry. However, you can also use sirloin steak, skirt steak, Denver steak, or even beef chuck.</p>
        <p>Beef chuck steak is the most economical choice, but it does require some extra trimming. You'll want to remove the tough tissue from the steaks before frying</p>
