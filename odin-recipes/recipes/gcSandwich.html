    <h4>Best Cheese for Grilled Cheese</h4>
        <p>This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese â€“ it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.</p>
        <p>Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti.</p>
